This project is a web application built with React.js and Bootstrap, which serves as a task management platform. Users can create an account and access their profile to create new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

The application consumes a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js, which handles user and task data. MongoDB is used for data storage.
